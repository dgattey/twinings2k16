# Twinings 2k16
The official website for the Twining Awards 2016 for Brown University's Computer Science department.

This is a static Jekyll site for speed and simplicity. The source is in the `twinings` subdirectory, and it builds to `twinings/_site` when you run `jekyll liveserve` in the subdirectory. Have fun!
